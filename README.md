Vertical Search Engine for Students of Self-taught Higher Education Examination，China


I built a vertical search engine which mainly attend to help students who try to take the Higher Education Examination Program for the Self-taught of China（HEEP）. I try to help people to find higher quality websites and resources by this vertical search engine.

Firstly, I checked a list of the high quality of Higher education students in self-examination websites. Compare with the general search engine, the architecture of this vertical search is only precise on the target information mining. The VIP-Style order paradise helps the self-taught users can find target information more easily when they use this vertical system.

Secondly, the ELFHash algorithm was embraced on the web crawler of this vertical search engine. The hash value was mainly used to control the multi-thread of the web crawler. And the frontier values of the web crawler also were used to finding the target websites more efficiently.

Thirdly, I checked the pages of target websites by regular expression and Htmlparser, and also try to keep the execute progress of pages analysis on the optimize level. 

Fourthly, I mainly use the DWR+Spring Modes to connect backstage and front stage of this system. The stable and kinds of DWR classes can make sure the system in a stable condition when the synchronization searching is running. The interactive of DWR and Ajax can make sure users can use this system easily and with a quick response time. And also, such system structural can help the system running keep at a low cost.
